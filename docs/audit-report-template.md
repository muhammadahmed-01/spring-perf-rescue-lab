## Executive Summary

**Bottom line:** The orders listing endpoint is executing 111 SQL statements per request due to a Hibernate N+1 SELECT pattern. Under 100,000 k6 requests (100 VUs), this drives p95 latency to 1,605 ms and limits throughput to 115 req/s. A single JOIN FETCH on the hot read path reduces the query count to 1, cuts p95 to 760 ms (2.1x improvement), and raises throughput to 198 req/s on the same hardware.

**Business impact:** Every page load on this endpoint amplifies database load linearly with order count. At production traffic, this pattern causes connection pool pressure, unpredictable p99 spikes, and wasted infrastructure spend on queries that should never fire. The fix is low effort (one repository method) with high impact.

**Risk if unaddressed:** High. Read amplification scales with data volume. A traffic spike or marketing campaign will expose this as a P0 outage, not a gradual slowdown.

**Evidence standard:** All numbers below are measured, not estimated. Query counts from Hibernate `StatementInspector`. Latency from k6 load test (100 VUs, 100,000 shared iterations). Query plans from EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

## Findings

| ID | Area | Observation | Evidence |
|----|------|-------------|----------|
| F-1 | ORM mapping | `Order.items` and `Order.user` are `FetchType.LAZY`; service iterates all orders and touches both associations | `OrderQueryService.mapOrderWithLazyLoads` |
| F-2 | Query count | Buggy path executes 111 SELECTs (1 + 100 + 10) | `GET /api/orders/stats/buggy`, `X-Query-Count: 111` |
| F-3 | Query plan | Buggy item fetch scans `order_items` with a filter per order | `docs/explain-analyze.md` |
| F-4 | Fixed path | Single DISTINCT query with JOIN FETCH loads orders, users, and items | `OrderRepository.findAllOrdersWithItemsAndUser` |
| F-5 | Latency | k6 p95 improved 1,605 ms to 760 ms under 100k requests | `load/k6-load.js`, see README metrics table |

## Priority Matrix (P0 / P1 / P2)

| Priority | Item | Impact | Effort |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Replace lazy iteration on orders list with JOIN FETCH or `@EntityGraph` | High: removes 110 extra round trips per request | Low (1 repository method) |
| **P1** | Add integration test asserting SQL count ≤ 2 on orders list | Medium: prevents regression | Low |
| **P1** | Enable slow-query log + Hibernate statistics in staging | Medium: catches next hot path | Low |
| **P2** | Add index on `order_items(order_id)` if seq scans appear at scale | Medium at higher row counts | Low |
| **P2** | Pagination on orders list (limit 50) | Medium at scale | Low |

**Recommended sequence:** Ship P0 immediately. Add P1 guards before next release. Schedule P2 when row counts or traffic warrant.

## Recommendations

1. **Ship JOIN FETCH fix to production** for the orders list endpoint; validate with Hibernate statistics before/after deploy.
2. **Add a CI guard** that fails if orders list executes more than 2 queries (pattern from `/api/orders/stats/*`).
3. **Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE** on staging after deploy; attach plans to ticket (commands in `docs/explain-analyze.md`).
4. **Load test** with k6 at expected peak VUs; track p95/p99 and pool wait time.
5. **Document** read-path fetch strategy in team wiki so new endpoints do not reintroduce N+1.
