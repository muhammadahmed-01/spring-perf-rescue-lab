## Upwork Portfolio Title

**Spring Boot + PostgreSQL N+1 Rescue: 111 Queries to 1, p95 134 ms to 17 ms**

---

## Upwork Portfolio Description (3 sentences)

I built a reproducible performance case study that documents a Hibernate N+1 failure on a Spring Boot orders API and the JOIN FETCH fix with measured before/after numbers. The reference implementation runs in Docker: k6 load tests show p95 latency dropping from 134 ms to 17 ms while SQL round trips fall from 111 to 1 per request. It mirrors the same investigation process I used on a production ORM path at Careem (p99 8s to under 1s, 1,286 queries to 2 batch calls).

## GitHub README Pin Suggestion

**Repository:** https://github.com/muhammadahmed-01/spring-perf-rescue-lab

Pin the repo and lead the README with the metrics table and the `docs/images/query-count-comparison.png` screenshot. Link to:

- `docs/PHASE-1-AUDIT-SOW.md` (proposal scope)
- `docs/audit-report-template.md` (sample deliverable)
- `PORTFOLIO-ASSETS.md` (this file)

**Pin description (short):** Reproducible N+1 case study with k6 + EXPLAIN. 111 queries to 1, p95 134 ms to 17 ms.

## For Complex Projects (Positioning)

Real client systems combine ORM issues with caching, connection pools, external APIs, and infra limits. This case study does not promise a single JOIN FETCH fixes every production incident. It proves a **repeatable audit process**: capture baseline query count, run one EXPLAIN, prioritize P0/P1/P2, ship a minimal fix, and re-measure on the same hardware. Phase 1 scope is defined in `docs/PHASE-1-AUDIT-SOW.md`. Careem-scale work used the same sequence at larger data and traffic; deeper distributed or infra problems are scoped as follow-on work.

## LinkedIn Post Snippet

Shipped a portfolio case study: Spring Boot + PostgreSQL N+1 from 111 SQL calls to 1, p95 134 ms to 17 ms. Docker + k6 + EXPLAIN, same audit flow I used in production. Repo link in comments.
